# Local File Organizer

This project is a local file organizer that processes files in a specified input directory, generates metadata using AI models, and organizes them into a structured output directory based on the generated metadata.

## Introduction

The Local File Organizer automates the process of organizing files by:

- Scanning a specified input directory for files.
- Generating descriptions, folder names, and filenames using LLM models.
- Organizing the files into a new directory structure based on the generated metadata.


## Features

- **Automated File Organization:** Automatically sorts files into folders based on LLM categories.
- **Metadata Generation:** Generates descriptions and filenames using LLM models.
- **Support for Multiple File Types:** Handles images, text files, and PDFs.
- **Parallel Processing:** Utilizes multiprocessing to speed up file processing.
- **Customizable Prompts:** Prompts used for LLM model interactions can be customized.

## Supported file types include:

- **Images:** `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.bmp`
- **Text Files:** `.txt`, `.docx`
- **PDFs:** `.pdf`
## Prerequisites

- **Operating System:** Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Python Version:** Python 3.12
- **Conda:** Anaconda or Miniconda installed.
- **Git:** For cloning the repository (or you can download the code as a ZIP file).

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/NexaAI/nexa-sdk.git
```

Or download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to your desired location.

### 2. Set Up the Python Environment

Create a new Conda environment named `local_file_organizer` with Python 3.12:

```zsh
conda create --name local_file_organizer python=3.12
```

Activate the environment:

```zsh
conda activate local_file_organizer
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Ensure you are in the project directory and install the required dependencies using `requirements.txt`:

```zsh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** If you encounter issues with any packages, install them individually:

```zsh
pip install nexa Pillow pytesseract PyMuPDF python-docx
```

## Configuration

Before running the script, you need to set the input (`base_path`) and output (`new_path`) directories in `main.py`.

Open `main.py` and locate and modify the following lines to point to your desired input and output directories:

```python
# Paths configuration
input_path = "Path/to/your/input/files/or/folder"
output_path = "Path/to/your/output/files/or/folder"
```

**Example:**

```python
# Paths configuration
input_path = "/home/user/documents/input_files"
output_path = "/home/user/documents/organized_files"
```

## Usage

With the environment activated and dependencies installed, run the script using:

```zsh
python main.py
```

The script will:

1. Display the directory tree of your input directory.
2. Inform you that the files have been uploaded and processing will begin.
3. Process each file, generating metadata.
4. Copy and rename the files into the output directory based on the generated metadata.
5. Display the directory tree of your output directory after processing.

## Example Output

```
Directory tree before renaming:
Path/to/your/input/files/or/folder
├── image.jpg
├── document.pdf
├── notes.txt
└── sub_directory
    └── picture.png

1 directory, 4 files
*****************
The files have been uploaded successfully. Processing will take a few minutes.

File: Path/to/your/input/files/or/folder/image1.jpg
Description: [Generated description]
Folder name: [Generated folder name]
Generated filename: [Generated filename]
--------------------------------------------------
File: Path/to/your/input/files/or/folder/document.pdf

Directory tree after copying and renaming:

├── category2
│   └── generated_filename.pdf
└── category3
    └── generated_filename.png

3 directories, 3 files
```

**Note:** The actual descriptions, folder names, and filenames will be generated by the AI models based on your files' content.

## Notes

- **SDK Models:**
  - The script uses `NexaVLMInference` and `NexaTextInference` models.
  - Ensure you have access to these models and they are correctly set up.
  - You may need to download model files or configure paths.

- **Dependencies:**
  - **pytesseract:** Requires Tesseract OCR installed on your system.
    - **macOS:** `brew install tesseract`
    - **Ubuntu/Linux:** `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`
    - **Windows:** Download from [Tesseract OCR Windows Installer](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
  - **PyMuPDF (fitz):** Used for reading PDFs.

- **Processing Time:**
  - Processing may take time depending on the number and size of files.
  - The script uses multiprocessing to improve performance.

- **Customizing Prompts:**
  - You can adjust prompts in `data_processing.py` to change how metadata is generated.
